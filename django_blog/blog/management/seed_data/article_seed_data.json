        "content": "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.\n\nIt allows developers to create large web applications that update and render efficiently in response to data changes. Components are the building blocks of React apps.\n\nJSX lets you write HTML in JavaScript. React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance.\n\nIn this article, we'll walk through creating your first React app using `create-react-app`, understanding component lifecycles, and managing state with hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.\n\nYou'll also learn how to create reusable components, pass data with props, and manage user input.\n\nBy the end, you'll understand how props, state, and effects work together to build responsive UIs.\n\nReact encourages breaking your UI into small, reusable pieces. Using tools like React DevTools, you'll gain insight into component hierarchies and state flows.\n\nWe’ll also touch on more advanced topics such as conditional rendering, list rendering with `.map()`, and how to work with controlled vs uncontrolled components.\n\nReact is widely used in both startups and enterprise-scale projects, so this foundation opens doors to many opportunities.",

        "content": "Django’s Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) provides a high-level abstraction for database access.\n\nInstead of writing raw SQL, developers define models in Python. Django translates these models into queries behind the scenes.\n\nFor example, `Book.objects.filter(author__name='Alice')` becomes an SQL query that filters books by author.\n\nThis article covers relationships (OneToOne, ForeignKey, ManyToMany), query optimization, and how to leverage Django Admin with the ORM.\n\nMastering the ORM is key to writing scalable Django apps.\n\nWe also discuss `select_related` and `prefetch_related` for performance tuning. These allow you to optimize database hits in views that return related data.\n\nAnother vital concept is custom model managers and querysets, which enable encapsulating complex logic into reusable methods.\n\nYou'll also explore migrations — how Django tracks changes to models and generates SQL to evolve your database schema.\n\nFinally, we’ll touch on using the shell (`python manage.py shell`) to experiment with queries interactively — a powerful tool during development and debugging.",
